Two-finger typists, sometimes also referred to as \"hunt and peck\" typists, commonly reach sustained speeds of about 37 wpm for memorized text and 27 wpm when copying text, but in bursts may be able to reach much higher speeds. From the 1920s through the 1970s, typing speed (along with shorthand speed) was an important secretarial qualification and typing contests were popular and often publicized by typewriter companies as promotional tools.',\n  ];\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"example-text\">\n      <WindupChildren>\n        <SkipButton />\n        <div key={milisecondsPerCharacter}>\n          <Pace getPace={(char) => milisecondsPerCharacter}>\n            <div>{exampleText[0]}</div>\n            <br />\n            <div>{exampleText[1]}</div>\n            <br />\n            <div>{exampleText[2]}</div>\n            <br />\n            <div>{exampleText[3]}</div>\n            <br />\n            {\"from \"}\n            <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_per_minute\">\n              {\"Wikipedia page on WPM\"}\n            </a>\n          </Pace>\n        </div>\n        <RewindButton />\n      </WindupChildren>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default ExampleText;\n","import React from \"react\";\n\n//  Used to set WPM the site is running based on the input text box.\nconst Input = ({ wpm, onChange }) => {\n  return (\n    <input\n      className=\"input-reset\"\n      type=\"number\"\n      size=\"1\"\n      value={wpm}\n      onChange={onChange}\n      maxLength=\"3\"\n      min=\"1\"\n      max=\"999\"\n    ></input>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Input;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport \"./NotableSpeeds.css\";\n\n//  Used to set WPM the site is running based on notable/historic examples.\nconst NotableSpeeds = ({ onClick }) => {\n  const labelValuePairs = [\n    { label: \"'Hunt and Peck' typist\", wpm: 27 },\n    { label: \"Average Speed in 1990\", wpm: 32 },\n    { label: \"Low threshold for professional typist\", wpm: 50 },\n    { label: \"Stenotype typists as fast as\", wpm: 226 },\n    { label: \"Guiness world record holder\", wpm: 360 },\n  ];\n\n  const notableSpeeds = labelValuePairs.map((speed) => {\n    return (\n      <li value={speed.wpm} onClick={onClick} key={speed.wpm}>\n        {`${speed.label}: ${speed.wpm}`}\n      </li>\n    );\n  });\n  return <ul className=\"notable-speeds list\">{notableSpeeds}</ul>;\n};\n\nexport default NotableSpeeds;\n","import React, { useState } from \"react\";\n\nimport \"tachyons\";\nimport \"./App.css\";\n\nimport ExampleText from \"./components/ExampleText\";\nimport Input from \"./components/Input\";\nimport NotableSpeeds from \"./components/NotableSpeeds\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [wpm, setWPM] = useState(90);\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <header className=\"App-header\">\n        <h1>Slow typer?
